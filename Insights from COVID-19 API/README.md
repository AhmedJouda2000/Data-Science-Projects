# Insights from a COVID-19 API
- The aim of this analysis is to analyze the COVID-19 API consisting of each country's statistics around confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries.
- This will allow us to analyse different waves of the virus, discuss in which months they occured and what features did these waves have in Ireland, Italy and Sweden. Ireland and Italy were chosen as they have had a similar trend with the virus and Sweden was chose because it had no lockdowns imposed.
